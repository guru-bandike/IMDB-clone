# IMDb Clone Project

This project is a simplified clone of the IMDb website, focusing on the core features that allow users to search for movies or series, manage a favourites list, view movie ratings, and directly access official IMDb pages for more detailed information. It includes three main pages: Home, Favourites, and Movie Details, each offering specific functionalities to enhance the user experience.

## Compatibility

Designed to be compatible with older browsers, this project avoids using modern JavaScript modules, which are not supported by some older browsers. Instead, it relies on a shared set of Vanilla JavaScript and CSS files to ensure broad accessibility.
